        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        <p>On my first day of school, I was in 1st class.My first friend was Kiara.We played a lot.But we fighted a lot too.Our class teacher kept me to stop talking.In each Open House my ma'am would say I am talkative.In my 2nd class my first friend was Eva Didi.We didn't studied in the same class but we can still call it first friend in class. We had a lot of fun too. We all were on the same bus while going back to home. In my 3rd class my first friend was Kiara.She and my first friend in 1st class had the same name.In my 4th class I had no first friend.And now I am in 5th class.The classes has not been started. I hope I make more first friends.</p>
